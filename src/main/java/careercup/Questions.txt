- Print all numbers satisfying the expression 2^i * 5^i (where i, j are integers i &gt;= 0 and j &gt;= 0) in
  increasing order up to a given bound N.
  2^i stands for power(2, i).

  abc \ ca equals abcA
  \ b = backspace
  \ c = CapsLock

  + * A B / C D  -&gt;  A B * C D / +

- convert a Sorted linkedList to complete BST

- Given list of edge in the graph, find the number of reversed pairs,(1,2)
  and (2,1) are such pair. Follow up: How to implement the distributed version.

- To several bus lines, each line is a two-way line, such as:
  0: A &lt;-&gt; B &lt;-&gt; D
  1: C &lt;-&gt; D
  give you a start and end, find the path through the least station. followup
  Asked the least transfer case

- Determine whether the inorder of n binary trees is the same

- Give you a csv file There are three columns are id, parent, weight Then give you a class
  Node which has these three fields
  But you also have the option of adding more fields for you to print out all the node's subwebs.
  The definition of subweight is the sum of the node's weight plus the subweight of his children.

- Give a chessboard, check if a group of white chesses are surrounded by all black chesses.

- Given a list of relationship of report
  A reported to D, D reported to Z, who are reported to Z

-Decompress string - string (s) followed by {n} denotes s repeating n times
 "a(b(c){2}){2}d" decompresses to "abccbccd"
 "((x){3}(y){2}z){2}" decompresses to "xxxyyzxxxyyz"

- how to check is a small matrix appear in a big matrix
  boolean isSubmatrix(int[][] small, int[][] big)

- Data structure for Task Dependency
  A task can start only after all its pre-requisites are done
  Code the methods addTask(preRequisiteTask, dependentTask)
  getExecutionSequence()


- Input is an integer array A
  Return an array B such that B[i] = product of all elements of A except A[i]


- Given any uppercase string. Report the starting index at which any valid permutation of
  ABCDEF starts. If not found, then report -1.
  Possible permutations of ABCDEF are ABCDFE, BCDAFE, FEDCAB etc (a total of 6! = 720 permutations)


- Find the sum of all nodes stored in a tree

- Convert an integer to base-3 equivalent


- Given two strings - S1 and S2.
  Arrange the characters of S1 in same alphabetical order as the characters of S2.
  If a character of S1 is not present in S2 - such characters should come at the end of
  the result string, but make sure to retain the order of such characters
  Case sensitivity is irrelevant
  e.g. S1 = "Google", S2 = "dog"
  Output = "ooggle"
  e.g. S1 = "abcdedadf", S2 = "cae"
  Output = "caaebdddf"

- A sequence of strings, printed first by column, on a screen of width K,
  Requires the first column of the same column by column alignment,
  At least one character interval between columns and columns,
  Ask how many lines at least?
  The string sequence is {"abc", "de", "fghij", "k", "lmno", "p"}
  The screen width is 10
  The answer is at least 3 lines
  abc k
  de lmno
  fghij p

- Give a decimal number, such as 123. Asking a total of smaller num than 123 made up by 1 and 0 composed of
  decimal numbers.
  111, 110, 101, 100, 11, 10, 1, 0.

- To a word, and a map, map which is a word, ask this if a word is smash able? That is, you can smash one letter
  each time, and the rest of the letters can form a single word (the new word is still in the map) until it is
  completely hit.
  For example: sprint -&gt; print -&gt; pint -&gt; pit -&gt; it -&gt; i -&gt; ""

- Minimum number of swaps of chars in only one string to make two strings the same

- Given an array {a0, a1, a2, ... an, b0, b1, b2 ... bn},
  Rearrange this array into {a0, b0, a1, b1, a2, b2, ... an, bn}
  inplace, O (1) space


- Suppose there is a map with N bikes on it and now we have N individuals,
  Design an algorithm so that everyone can get the bike in the shortest distance

- Give you a bunch of light bulbs. Can flip a range of open change off, turn off open, and then asked to do so k times
  later, just ask you a light bulb is turned on or turned off, how to do

- Give a  string [] words,
  Find the shortest string [] containing the keyword inside.
  words: sky cloud google search sky work blue
  keywords: sky blue
  return: sky work blue

- Given an array, find the number of   tuple such that A [i] + A [j] + A [k] = A [l] in an array,
  here i j k l.

- Given one string s1, and then insert one char into this string at any place, to get s2, find the inserted char
  Could you do it in logn time

- Give a weighted n-nary tree and find the longest path from the root node to the leaf node

    }

- Given a binary matrix, count the number of square that can be formed by all 0s
